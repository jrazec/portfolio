## Portfolio

This portfolio project was created for my Web Systems and Technologies class. 

# for the Design
I opted for a minimalist design, utilizing the following:

**Fonts:** 
- Montseratt > accent font
- Poppins > text content font
- Roboto > sub title fonts

**Colors:**
- Black: #3E363F > background
- Gray: #E0E0E0 > text color fonts 
- Green: #56d394 > accent color

## Challenges faced..

1. **Viewport Units** (vw and vh) 

- One of the most frustrating challenges I encountered was working with vw and vh units. When switching between monitors, especially to my second monitor, I noticed that text and layout elements would become uneven and distorted. After researching, I found an article advising against the use of vw and vh for responsive design, as they can behave unpredictably across different screen sizes.

2. **Responsiveness Issues**

- Another major hurdle was fixing the responsiveness of the About Me section. Ensuring that the layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes while maintaining its integrity was a tricky process.

3. **Designing**

- As someone who is not a graphic designer and is also color blind by passion(this is a pun), design decisions were particularly challenging. Sticking to a consistent layout and color scheme required extra effort, as I struggled with understanding certain visual contrasts.

## How I resolved..

1. **Viewport Units**, I ultimately replaced the vw and vh units with more reliable CSS techniques, like using percentages and rem units for better responsiveness and consistency across devices.

2. **Responsiveness**, I restructured my media queries and ensured that I used flexible grids and containers to improve the layout on different screen sizes(especially in my About Me Section as its really complicated).

3. **Design**, I stuck to my original Figma design, which helped me stay consistent, though I believe the design still has room for improvement.
